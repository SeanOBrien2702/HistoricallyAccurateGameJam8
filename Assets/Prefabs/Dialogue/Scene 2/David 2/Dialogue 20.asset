  dialogueText: "David didn\u2019t feel like bringing George into his and Maitland\u2019s
    small feud any further. If anything, Maitland circumventing him entirely to get
    to the queen was annoying at most. Even if he did have George address the queen
    in court without going through David, the queen would turn him down. "
