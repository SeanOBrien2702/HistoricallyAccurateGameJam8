  dialogueText: No, Lord Ruthven, I will not grant this request. And the next ask
    of yours had best be on the floor of Court with other eyes and ears on you because
    if you so much as approach me in close quarters during an event again with such
    a dubious and selfish question, I will have you carried away so fast you will
    have wished your lordship had passed you in line.
