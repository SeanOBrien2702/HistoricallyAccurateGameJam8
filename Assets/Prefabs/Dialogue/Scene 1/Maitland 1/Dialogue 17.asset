  dialogueText: At last, William has struck a nerve. When a lord smiles, it is a
    lie. It is fake. Undertones and faces were a tricky matter, yet easily manipulated.
    All William had to do was know what lay underneath. Although David Rizzio was
    not a lord, he played up to the act quite well.
